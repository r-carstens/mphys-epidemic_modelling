# mphys-epidemic_modelling

All simulations and analysis used in my MPhys project regarding 'Modelling the impact of catastrophic events on the emergence of vector-borne infectious disease variants'. Example catastrophic events include floods or droughts, which can cause population or pathogen bottlenecks. These bottlenecks may cause changes to the underlying transmission dyanamics, and the emergence of pathogen variants.
